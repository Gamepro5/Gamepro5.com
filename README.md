# Gamepro5.com

A secondary repository for submitting issue reports, since the main code is private.

Feature requests go [here](https://github.com/Gamepro5/Gamepro5.com/discussions/categories/ideas), in "Ideas". If you have questions, you can chat in the Q&A [here](https://github.com/Gamepro5/Gamepro5.com/discussions/categories/q-a). Otherwise, things that are actually issues (bug reports) go in [issues](https://github.com/Gamepro5/Gamepro5.com/issues).
